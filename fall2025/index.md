## Abstracts:

E. Kakariadis, ___Selfadjoint operator spaces___

Abstract: Operator systems, i.e., closed, selfadjoint subspaces of $\B(H)$
containing its unit, have a central role in the theory of Operator
Algebras. Lately, the community has been actively considering selfadjoint
operator subspaces, but which need not be unital. Those appear naturally,
for example when comparing operator systems up to their stabilisations as
in the work of Connes and van Suijlekom.

The absence of a unit disrupts the link between the norm and the matrix
order structure, and thus many of the standard results from the unital
setting no longer apply. This creates significant difficulties in
obtaining even fundamental theorems like the celebrated Arveson's
Extension Theorem. Towards this end, Werner introduced the notion of the
partial unitisation that encapsulates the appropriate information for
matrix ordered operator space to be represented as a selfadjoint subspace
of some B(H).

It appears that the injective morphisms in this category are those that
lift to unital completely isometric maps on the unitisation, and not just
the completely isometric complete order embeddings. In this talk I will
present why this is the right notion, and (old and new) characterisations
of such maps in terms of extensions and gauge isometries (in the sense of
Russell), with a focus on approximately positively generated or singly
generated spaces. We will show, in action and with examples, that the
question whether a map is an embedding is a norm-preservence question.

This is joint work with Alexandros Chatzinikolaou, Se-Jin (Sam) Kim, and
Apollonas Paraskevas.
