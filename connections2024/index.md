## Outline

### Lecture 1

- 1st-order differential calculus of a spectral triple, connections.
- The abstract picture and the universal differential calculus, its failure.
- The junk forms.
- 2nd-order differential calculus of a spectral triple, the curvature of a connection.
- A non-junk factoid.

### Lecture 2

- Dagger bimodules, frames, left/right adjointable operators.
- Index lowering and raising with daggers.
- Connections on dagger bimodules, Hermitian connections, Graßmann connections, conjugate connections.
- Torsion of a connection.
- Torsion-free and Hermitian connections.

### Lecture 3

- The two projections problem, concordant submodules.
- Concordant Hermitian differential structures.
- Bram Mesland's condition for dagger-concordance. Uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection.
- Uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection.
- Braidings, "real" forms, dagger-bimodule connections.
- Example: the Podleś sphere.
