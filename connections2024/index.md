# Mini-course: connections and curvatures in noncommutative geometry

## 2024 Spring

In March 2024, Prof. Adam Rennie (Wollongong) gave a mini-course on **connections and curvatures in noncommutative geometry**, based on joint work of him and Bram Mesland:

- B. Mesland and A. Rennie, [*Existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection on noncommutative differential forms*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13735).
- B. Mesland and A. Rennie, [*Curvature and Weitzenbock formula for spectral triples*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07957).

Lectures took place on Tuesdays from 15.15 to 17.00.

## Outline

### Lecture 1

- 1st-order differential calculus of a spectral triple, connections.
- The abstract picture. The universal differential calculus and its failure.
- Junk forms.
- 2nd-order differential calculus of a spectral triple. The curvature of a connection.
- A non-junk factoid.

### Lecture 2

- Dagger bimodules. Frames. Left/right adjointable operators.
- Index lowerings and raisings with daggers.
- Connections on dagger bimodules, Hermitian connections, Graßmann connections, conjugate connections.
- The torsion of a connection.
- Torsion-freeness and Hermitian connections.

### Lecture 3

- The two projections problem. Concordant submodules.
- Concordant Hermitian differential structures.
- Mesland's creteria for dagger-concordance.
- Uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection.
