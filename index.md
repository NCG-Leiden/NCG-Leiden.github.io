# Noncommutative Geometry Reading Seminar
## Topic for 2023 Fall Semester: Foliations

In 2023 fall semester, we are running a seminar on foliations, focusing on their noncommutative geometry. The noncommutative geometry of foliations was initiated by Alain Connes in the late 1970s, when he realised that the geometry of a foliation can be encoded in a noncommutative C\*-algebra. The construction is in two steps: one first builds the holonomy groupoid of the foliation, then takes its reduced groupoid C\*-algebra. This C\*-algebra might be viewed as the "noncommutative space" of leaves, and is the desired receptacle for the index theory of longitudinal elliptic operators. This was achieved in the seminal work of Connes and Skandalis. We will reach this topic at the end of this seminar.

Another focus of the seminar is to understand certain foliations arising from dynamical systems. Lindsey and Treviño have constructed translation surfaces from bi-infinite Bratteli diagrams using combinatorial methods. These were further studied by Putnam and Treviño with operator algebraic techniques. Moreover, Putnam and Treviño build explicit relations between the groupoid C\*-algebras constructed from the Bratteli diagram, and the C\*-algebras constructed from suitable foliations on the translation surface. This also allows them to compute the K-theory of the aforementioned C\*-algebras.

An announcement, including some preliminary topics of talks, can be found [here](https://ncg-leiden.github.io/foliation2023/foliation_announcement).
