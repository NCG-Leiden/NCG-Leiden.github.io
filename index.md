# Noncommutative Geometry Reading Seminar
## Topic for September-December 2022: Groupoid C*-algebras

In the 2022 fall semester, we are running a seminar on Groupoids and C*-algebras. 

We will follow the text book ___A Tool Kit for Groupoid C*-algebras___ in the first couple of talks and then turn to related topics including but not limited to semigroups, graphs, foliations, and twisted groupoids. 

This page will be updated regularly with details on topics and the remaining schedule.
