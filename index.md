# Noncommutative Geometry Research Seminar

## 2024 spring semester

In 2024 spring semester, the noncommutative geometry group of Leiden university is running a local NCG research seminar on Wednesdays from 15:15-16:15 at DM 1.19 (New Gorlaeus building).

If you want to be added to the mailing list for this seminar, please contact [Francesca Arici](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~aricif2/) or [Bram Mesland](https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~meslandb2/).

## Upcoming talks

7 Feb 2024: **Adam Rennie** (Wollongong)

**Title**: Using the Cayley transform to relate van Daele K-theory and KK

**Abstract**: I will start with a warm-up in the (friendly) complex case showing that $K_1(A)\cong KK^1(\mathbb{C},A)$ via the Cayley transform. Then I will show that the ``same'' thing works in real, Real, graded cases when we start with van Daele K-theory. This will involve some discussion of van Daele K-theory, and how one defines it...which is slightly intricate. 

Why did we want to do all that? Make Kasparov products easy of course!!

Joint work with Chris Bourne and Johannes Kellendonk.

14 Feb 2024: **Yufan Ge** (Leiden)

**Title**: SU(2)-symmetries of C*-algebras: from bricks to buildings

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems coming from SU(2)-representations and discuss the associated C*-algebras. We will first review results concerning irreducible representations from Arici--Kaad, then provide some further results about more general cases. More specifically, we will discuss the structure of the SU(2)- subproduct systems associated to isotypic representations and multiplicity-free representations. Finally, we will provide results about the K-theory groups of their Toeplitz algebras. This is joint work in progress with Francesca Arici.

## Previous talks

24 Jan 2024: **Francesca Arici** (Leiden)

**Title**: Some results about the K-theory of C*-algebras of subproduct systems

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems of Hilbert spaces and their Toeplitz and Cuntzâ€“Pimsner algebras, and discuss their relation to the theory of polynomials in noncommuting variables. We will provide results about their topological invariants through K(K)-theory and discuss some open problems.
