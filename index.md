## Upcoming talks

20 Mar 2024: **Bram Mesland** (Leiden)

**Title**: The Friedrichs angle and alternating projections in Hilbert C\*-modules

**Abstract**: In his foundational work on rings of operators, John von Neumann proved that given two projections P,Q on a Hilbert space, the sequence (PQ)^n converges in the \*-strong topology to the projection onto the intersection of the ranges of P and Q. The finer convergence properties of the sequence (PQ)^n are detected by a numerical invariant called the Friedrichs angle between P and Q. In this talk I will discuss the generalization of this problem to the setting of Hilbert C\*-modules, where various technicalities present itself. The main issue is the fact that the intersection of complemented submodules need not be complemented. Due to this issue, von Neumann’s convergence result does not hold for an arbitrary pair of projections, and the Friedrichs angle cannot be straightforwardly defined. A definition of the Friedrichs angle can be obtained using the local-global principle for Hilbert modules, and yields an invariant that effectively detects the properties of the sequence (PQ)^n. I will discuss (counter)examples and interpretations of this result in noncommutiative geometry.

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

## Previous talks


13 Mar 2024: **Aquerman Kuczmenda Yanes** (Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen)

**Title**: Equivariant Spectral Flow for Families of Dirac-type Operators

**Abstract**: In this talk we show how to construct an equivariant version of spectral flow for paths of Dirac-type operators in the setting of a proper, cocompact action by a locally compact, unimodular group $G$ on a Riemannian manifold. This takes values in the $K$-theory of the group $C^*$-algebra of $G$. Our goal is to show that our equivariant spectral flow refines classical spectral in the case where $G$ is the fundamentalg roup of a compact manifold. If time permits, we look into its relationship with higher index theory and secondary invariants. Joint work with Peter Hochs.

**Place and time**: DM 1.19. 15:15-16:15.

6 Mar 2024: **Teun van Nuland** (TU Delft)

**Title**: Multiple operator integrals and the abstract pseudodifferential calculus of Connes and Moscovici

**Abstract**: Multiple operator integrals (MOIs) appear in various areas of noncommutative geometry, like the theories of cyclic cohomology (cf. the JLO-cocycle), spectral flow, spectral shift, the spectral action, and heat trace asymptotics. Recognizing MOIs where they appear 'undercover' enables a unified view, and often leads to new connections and generalizations. However, sometimes the integral expressions that you want to uncover as MOIs are unbounded, which does not match the traditional MOI formalism as developed by Peller in 2006. Our proposed solution is to merge multiple operator integration with the abstract pseudodifferential calculus of Connes and Moscovici.Based on ongoing joint work with Eva-Maria Hekkelman and Edward McDonald.

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

28 Feb 2024: **Dimitris Gerontogiannis** (Leiden)

**Title**: KK-duality for Temperley-Lieb subproduct systems 

**Abstract**: The notion of KK-duality generalises Spanier-Whitehead duality in the noncommutative setting of C\*-algebras. As C\*-algebras are noncommutative topological spaces in view of the Gelfand duality, C\*-algebras with KK-duals can be thought of as noncommutative manifolds. Therefore, a main utility of KK-duality is that it makes it possible to study C\*-algebras by more classical analytic methods. Interestingly, several C\*-algebras associated to dynamical systems appear to have KK-duals. This talk is about the KK-duality of Cuntz-Pimsner algebras associated to Temperley-Lieb subproduct systems, a class of C\*-algebras with rich quantum group symmetries and relations to topological Markov chains. This is joint work with Francesca Arici (Leiden) and Sergey Neshveyev (Oslo). 

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

21 Feb 2024: **Sophie Zegers** (TU Delft)

**Title**: Split extensions and KK-equivalences for quantum flag manifolds

**Abstract**: In this talk, I will first present the explicit KK-equivalence between $C(\mathbb{C}P_q^n)$ and the commutative algebra $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ constructed in collaboration with Francesca Arici. The KK-equivalence is constructed by finding an explicit splitting for the short exact sequence $\mathcal{K}\to C(\mathbb{C}P_q^n)\to C(\mathbb{C}P_q^{n-1})$. In the construction of a splitting it is crucial that $C(\mathbb{C}P_q^n)$ can be described as a graph algebra. Secondly, I will present how this approach can be used to construct KK-equivalences in the more general framework of quantum flag manifolds which is based on ongoing work with Réamonn Ó Buachalla and Karen Strung.  

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

14 Feb 2024: **Yufan Ge** (Leiden)

**Title**: SU(2)-symmetries of C*-algebras: from bricks to buildings

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems coming from SU(2)-representations and discuss the associated C*-algebras. We will first review results concerning irreducible representations from Arici--Kaad, then provide some further results about more general cases. More specifically, we will discuss the structure of the SU(2)- subproduct systems associated to isotypic representations and multiplicity-free representations. Finally, we will provide results about the K-theory groups of their Toeplitz algebras. This is joint work in progress with Francesca Arici.

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

7 Feb 2024: **Adam Rennie** (Wollongong)

**Title**: Using the Cayley transform to relate van Daele K-theory and KK

**Abstract**: I will start with a warm-up in the (friendly) complex case showing that $K_1(A)\cong KK^1(\mathbb{C},A)$ via the Cayley transform. Then I will show that the “same” thing works in real, Real, graded cases when we start with van Daele K-theory. This will involve some discussion of van Daele K-theory, and how one defines it...which is slightly intricate. 

Why did we want to do all that? Make Kasparov products easy of course!!

Joint work with Chris Bourne and Johannes Kellendonk.

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

24 Jan 2024: **Francesca Arici** (Leiden)

**Title**: Some results about the K-theory of C*-algebras of subproduct systems

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems of Hilbert spaces and their Toeplitz and Cuntz–Pimsner algebras, and discuss their relation to the theory of polynomials in noncommuting variables. We will provide results about their topological invariants through K(K)-theory and discuss some open problems.

**Place and time**: DM 1.19. **15:30-16:30**.
