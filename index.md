## Upcoming talks

14 Feb 2024: **Yufan Ge** (Leiden)

**Title**: SU(2)-symmetries of C*-algebras: from bricks to buildings

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems coming from SU(2)-representations and discuss the associated C*-algebras. We will first review results concerning irreducible representations from Arici--Kaad, then provide some further results about more general cases. More specifically, we will discuss the structure of the SU(2)- subproduct systems associated to isotypic representations and multiplicity-free representations. Finally, we will provide results about the K-theory groups of their Toeplitz algebras. This is joint work in progress with Francesca Arici.

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

21 Feb 2024: **Sophie Zegers** (Delft)

**Title**: Split extensions and KK-equivalences for quantum flag manifolds

**Abstract**: In this talk, I will first present the explicit KK-equivalence between $C(\mathbb{C}P_q^n)$ and the commutative algebra $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ constructed in collaboration with Francesca Arici. The KK-equivalence is constructed by finding an explicit splitting for the short exact sequence of $C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{K}\to C(\mathbb{C}P_q^n)\to C(\mathbb{C}P_q^{n-1})$. In the construction of a splitting it is crucial that $C(\mathbb{C}P_q^n)$ can be described as a graph $C^*$-algebra. Secondly, I will present how this approach can be used to construct KK-equivalences in the more general framework of quantum flag manifolds which is based on ongoing work with Réamonn Ó Buachalla and Karen Strung.  

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

## Previous talks

7 Feb 2024: **Adam Rennie** (Wollongong)

**Title**: Using the Cayley transform to relate van Daele K-theory and KK

**Abstract**: I will start with a warm-up in the (friendly) complex case showing that $K_1(A)\cong KK^1(\mathbb{C},A)$ via the Cayley transform. Then I will show that the “same” thing works in real, Real, graded cases when we start with van Daele K-theory. This will involve some discussion of van Daele K-theory, and how one defines it...which is slightly intricate. 

Why did we want to do all that? Make Kasparov products easy of course!!

Joint work with Chris Bourne and Johannes Kellendonk.

**Place and time**: DM 1.15. 15:15-16:15.

24 Jan 2024: **Francesca Arici** (Leiden)

**Title**: Some results about the K-theory of C*-algebras of subproduct systems

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems of Hilbert spaces and their Toeplitz and Cuntz–Pimsner algebras, and discuss their relation to the theory of polynomials in noncommuting variables. We will provide results about their topological invariants through K(K)-theory and discuss some open problems.

**Place and time**: DM 1.19. **15:30-16:30**.
