# Noncommutative geometry research seminar

## 2024 spring semester

In 2024 spring semester, the noncommutative geometry group of Leiden university is running a local NCG research seminar on Wednesdays from 15:15-16:15. If you want to be added to the mailing list for this seminar, please contact Francesca Arici or Bram Mesland directly.

## Upcoming talks


7 Feb 2024: **Yufan Ge** (Leiden)

**Title**: SU(2)-symmetries of C*-algebras: from bricks to buildings

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems coming from SU(2)-representations and discuss the associated C*-algebras. We will first review results concerning irreducible representations from Arici--Kaad, then provide some further results about more general cases. More specifically, we will discuss the structure of the SU(2)- subproduct systems associated to isotypic representations and multiplicity-free representations. Finally, we will provide results about the K-theory groups of their Toeplitz algebras. This is joint work in progress with Francesca Arici.

## Previous talks

24 Jan 2024: **Francesca Arici** (Leiden)

**Title**: Some results about the K-theory of C*-algebras of subproduct systems

**Abstract**: In this talk, we will consider subproduct systems of Hilbert spaces and their Toeplitz and Cuntzâ€“Pimsner algebras, and discuss their relation to the theory of polynomials in noncommuting variables. We will provide results about their topological invariants through K(K)-theory and discuss some open problems.
